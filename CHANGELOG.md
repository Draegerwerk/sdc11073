## [2.0.0a2] - 2023-06-07

### Fixed
- fixed bug that mk_scopes only created a scope if a location was associated.
- fixed broken fault message generation in subscriptionsmanager_base. A previously removed method of 
namespace helper was still used. 
- fixed bug in constructor of dpws_types.ThisDeviceType. This could cause an invalid xml:lang attribute. 
- fixed bug that ContainerBase.node was not set in update_from_node

## [2.0.0a1] - 2023-06-01

### Changed
- Code follows PEP8 style (mostly)
- Using dependency injection, classes are defined in sdcdevice/components.py and sdcclients/components.py.
This allows users to replace components withs own ones and modify the behavior of client and device.
- All QNames of BICEPS participant model, message model and extension are predefined in 
pm_qnames.py, msg_qnames.py and ext_qnames.py. Users no longer need helper functions like domTag, msgTag, etc that
were needed in version 1.
- A lot of internal functionality was refactoring or rewritten.
- The API for role providers changed.
- The transactions API is simplified.
- code in repo is located under a src parent folder. 
- A lot of small changes and fixes, too many to list them all.

### Added
- Multiple SdcClient instances can use a shared HTTP Server.
- strict type checking for participant model data. When assigning a value, the data is checked and 
an exception is thrown if type is not as expected.
- Having multiple MDS in a single mdib is supported.
