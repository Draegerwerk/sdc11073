## Coding Standards / Style Guide

This section outlines the coding standards and style guidelines for our project. Adhering to these guidelines ensures
code readability, maintainability, and consistency across the project. It's crucial for all contributors to follow these
practices to facilitate collaboration and code quality.

### General Principles

- **Readability**: Code should be written to be readable by humans. Clarity is preferred over cleverness.
- **Consistency**: Follow the established patterns and practices in the project.
- **Simplicity**: Strive for simplicity in your code. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

### Formatting / Static Code Analysis

- Use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to ensure your code adheres to our coding standards.
- Use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking. Ensure your code is typed and passes mypy checks.

Checkout our [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/Draegerwerk/sdc11073/blob/master/pyproject.toml) for more details.

### Naming Conventions

- **Modules**: Use short, lowercase names. If necessary, use underscores to improve readability (e.g., `my_module`).
- **Classes**: Use the CapWords convention (e.g., `MyClass`).
- **Functions and Variables**: Use lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `my_function`).
- **Constants**: Use all uppercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).

### Comments

- Use inline comments sparingly and ensure they are relevant and add value.
- Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods. Follow
  the [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) format.

## Testing / Coverage

We take testing seriously to ensure the reliability and stability of our project. Here's how you can contribute to
testing:

### Running Tests

- To run the existing test suite, execute `pytest` at the root of the project. This will run all tests and display a
  report.
- Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

### Writing Tests

- When adding new features or fixing bugs, write tests that cover your changes. We strive for comprehensive test
  coverage to maintain code quality.
- Follow our project's conventions for test structure and naming. Tests should be placed in the `tests` directory.
- Use descriptive test function names that clearly state what is being tested.

### Test Coverage

- We aim for high test coverage but understand it's not always practical to achieve 100%. Focus on testing critical
  paths and complex logic.
- After running tests, check the coverage report to ensure your changes are adequately covered. You can generate a
  coverage report by running `pytest --cov=src`.
- We use [codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/Draegerwerk/sdc11073) to monitor test coverage. Ensure your pull request
  does not significantly decrease the project's overall coverage.

By following these guidelines, you help ensure that our project remains stable, reliable, and easy to maintain. Thank
you for contributing to our tests!

## How to create a pull request

Creating a pull request is a critical step in contributing to our project. Here's how to do it effectively:

1. **Ensure Your Branch is Up-to-Date**: Before starting, make sure your branch is up-to-date with the branch you're
   planning to merge into.

2. **Check Your Changes**:
    - Run tests with `pytest` to ensure all tests pass.
    - Use `ruff check /path/to/your/changes1 /path/to/your/changes2 ...` for static code analysis.
    - Apply `mypy /path/to/your/changes1 /path/to/your/changes2 ...` for type checking.

3. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.

4. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your fork of the repository.

5. **Create the Pull Request**:
    - Navigate to the original repository you forked from.
    - Click on the "Pull requests" tab and then the "New pull request" button.
    - Choose your fork and the branch with your changes as the "compare" branch and the branch of our repository you
      want to merge into as the "base" branch.
    - Fill in the pull request form with a clear title and a detailed description of your changes.
    - If your pull request is related to an issue or discussion thread, reference it in the description or/and under
      the "Development" section.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
    - After submitting, at least one of our maintainers has to review your pull request. Be open to feedback also from
      other contributors and ready to make adjustments as needed.
    - If requested, make further commits to your branch to address feedback.

7. **Acceptance and Merge**:
    - Once your pull request is approved by a project maintainer and all CI checks pass, it will be merged.
    - Congratulations! You've successfully contributed to the project.
